# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Prediction
# Designing a CNN model that can leverage the visual features in the diseased leaf(tomato leaf) and classify them into 10 classes along with a remedial measure to overcome the disease.
#This project presents a tomato leaf disease classification algorithm that leverages these distinct appearances and advances in computer vision made possible by deep learning.
